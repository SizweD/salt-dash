Our own dashboard for saltstack in a very very early state.


Its purpose will be to have an overview over:
* minion-status (up/down)
* grains
* pillars
* packages installed
* basic overview stuff like disk-usage, load-average and so on



to run it:
edit the config.py to suit your environment
then run : 
python routes.py
